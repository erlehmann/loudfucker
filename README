This is a loudfucker. It fucks loudness.

loudfucker is intended to be a cheap open source alternative /
substitute for The LevelatorÂ® from The Conversations Network, a
California nonprofit public benefit corporation that is antisocial
enough to not release source code.

When loudfucker is given a wave file, it creates a file that has
fucked loudness. Currently this means that the whole file has
approximately the same loudness, meaning silence is amplified. Thanks
to Georg from Auphonic for explaining how to calculate the gain factor
and that I need a sliding window to avoid loudness jumps.
